# Elementary operations

Elementary operations are those that do simple tasks. The currently implemented operations are the following:

- `Identity`: Simply returns the input without modification.
- `Join`: Takes many items than can be concatenated, and joins them into a single item.
- `Lambda`: Takes some function and applies it directly to the input.
